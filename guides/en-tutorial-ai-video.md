## Why AI Video Generation Matters in 2026

The numbers speak for themselves:

- **89% of marketers** say video gives them a positive ROI (Wyzowl, 2025)
- **Short-form video** is the #1 content format for lead generation
- AI-generated video costs **$0** vs. $1,000-$10,000 for traditional production
- Over **10 million users** are already creating AI videos monthly

Yet most people still think you need expensive software or video editing skills. You don't.

## What You'll Need

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari — any works)
- A text prompt (your idea in words)
- 2-5 minutes of your time
- That's it. Seriously.

## Step 1: Choose Your AI Video Platform

There are dozens of AI video tools in 2026, but they're not all equal. Here's what to look for:

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| Multiple AI models | Different models excel at different styles |
| Free tier available | Test before you commit |
| Resolution options | 720p minimum for social media |
| Style controls | Camera movement, lighting, aspect ratio |

For this tutorial, I'll use [HeyVid AI](https://heyvid.ai) because it aggregates 15+ top models (Kling, Veo 3, Sora 2, Runway, Hailuo, and more) in one interface — so you can compare outputs without switching platforms.

## Step 2: Write Your Text Prompt

This is where the magic happens. A good prompt has three parts:

### The Formula

```
[Subject] + [Action] + [Style/Mood] + [Technical Details]
```

### Examples

**Basic:** "A cat sitting on a windowsill"
**Better:** "A fluffy orange cat sitting on a sunlit windowsill, watching rain outside, cozy atmosphere, cinematic lighting"
**Best:** "Close-up of a fluffy orange tabby cat sitting on a wooden windowsill, watching raindrops slide down the glass, warm golden hour lighting, shallow depth of field, 4K cinematic quality"

### Pro Tips for Better Prompts

1. **Be specific about lighting** — "golden hour," "neon-lit," "soft diffused light"
2. **Mention camera angles** — "aerial shot," "close-up," "tracking shot"
3. **Include mood words** — "dramatic," "peaceful," "energetic"
4. **Specify duration** if the tool allows it — 5s is standard, 10s for complex scenes

## Step 3: Select Your AI Model

Different models have different strengths:

| Model | Best For | Available on HeyVid |
|-------|----------|:-------------------:|
| **Kling 2.0** | Realistic human motion | ✅ |
| **Veo 3** | Cinematic quality | ✅ |
| **Sora 2** | Creative/artistic styles | ✅ |
| **Runway Gen-4** | Consistent characters | ✅ |
| **Hailuo** | Fast generation, anime | ✅ |
| **Wan 2.1** | Open-source, customizable | ✅ |

On [HeyVid AI](https://heyvid.ai), you can try multiple models with the same prompt and pick the best result — a huge time saver.

## Step 4: Configure Your Settings

Before hitting "Generate," adjust these settings:

- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (YouTube/landscape), 9:16 (TikTok/Reels/Shorts), 1:1 (Instagram)
- **Duration:** 5 seconds (standard) or 10 seconds (extended)
- **Quality:** Standard for drafts, HD for final output
- **Camera Motion:** Pan, zoom, orbit, or static

## Step 5: Generate and Review

Click generate and wait 30-120 seconds. Here's what to expect:

1. The AI processes your prompt
2. You'll see a preview thumbnail
3. The full video renders and becomes downloadable

**If the result isn't perfect:**
- Adjust your prompt (add more detail)
- Try a different AI model
- Modify camera or style settings
- Use Image-to-Video mode for more control (upload a reference image first)

## Step 6: Advanced Techniques

Once you've mastered basic text-to-video, try these:

### Image-to-Video
Upload a photo or AI-generated image and animate it. Great for:
- Product demos
- Character animation
- Bringing artwork to life

### Video-to-Video
Transform existing footage with AI styling:
- Change seasons (summer → winter)
- Add visual effects
- Alter the artistic style entirely

### Video Transitions
Create smooth AI-powered transitions between clips — [HeyVid's transition tool](https://heyvid.ai) handles this beautifully.
